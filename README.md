# COMP3100 Stage 1 Assignment

## Overview

The task of this project is to design and implement the client version of a client-server simulation. This task will act as a job dispatcher using the Largest-Round-Robin (LRR) algorithm.

##  Running Simulation

* Ensure the host machine has installed java. Check this by running command: **java --version**.
* Open two terminals within the chosen OS and located the server-side file and client-side file.
* Run Server Side using command -n: **$ ./ds-server -n** (This is because the client code is written in Java and requires a newline character per message)
* Run Client Side (The code with this repository):  **$ java stageUno**
